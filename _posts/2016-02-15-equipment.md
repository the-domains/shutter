**Download Pro HDR X  - $2**

This 3rd party app from the App Store takes better HDR photos than the iPhone camera's built-in HDR feature. You can get by without it, but for $2, Pro HDR X is an inexpensive and easy way to greatly enhance your photos. 

The purpose of HDR is to bring more detail into the lights and darks. So for example, when a window is just white instead of blue with clouds, or your foreground is black instead of showing detail, HDR manages to increase the dynamic range so as to include more detail in all of these darker and lighter areas. This results in a "flatter" photo which gives it a more professional look.

**HELPFUL TIP:** Hold the camera very still while taking the photo. The HDR feature is actually taking three photos and the alignment is easier for the software to process if the camera is held very still.
