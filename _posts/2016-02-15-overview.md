# Overview

After shooting hundreds of listings as a real estate photographer, I've learned that it's not always the price of the gear that matters, but how you use it that really counts. So I developed a process to fully leverage the iPhone for real estate photography, incorporating techniques I use in the field while using professional DSLR cameras and editing software.

The iPhone, along with an additional, easy-to-use wide angle lens, becomes a sufficient setup for taking really great real estate photos that market well.

In this course, we personally walk through an actual home together and learn how to get the most out of your iOS device with shooting and editing, combined with staging, lighting, and composition tips. 

## The course is split into 5 sections: 

**Staging**

**Lighting**

**Equipment**

**Composition**

**Editing**

## Course time: 

3 hours

## What you will need:

* from the App Store: HDR Pro X ($2) and Enlight ($4)
* a wide angle lens for the iPhone or iPad ($30)
