# Staging

Prior to the shoot, email a "home prep list" to the homeowner. The homeowner will do at least most of these things (hopefully) and you will still want to do a spot check before shooting. 

## Home prep list:

* Declutter

* Turn on all lights

* Turn off all fans, TVs, and screens

* Leave blinds down and open at a slight angle

* Put away pet and child items as much as possible, unless the space is specifically designed to be a pet area, or a child's bedroom or playroom.
* Remove magnets and things from the refrigerator if possible
* Sweep off all outdoor entry ways, driveways, walkways, porches, and decks
* Rake leaves
* Landscape
