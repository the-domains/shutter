Empty rooms especially need this sort of help, and can be shot as low as 3-4 feet off the ground. </p><h2>Choose the right depth</h2><p>Always start framing the photo low, and then slowly raise the camera as needed until you have the depth in the room that you want. You want depth in order to see over things like table tops and ottomans, but only as much depth as you need, no more. There is a sweet spot where you are not looking too much from overhead, but also not too level. You can see everything in the room and there is just enough space and overlap between everything. You want to be looking through the room, not looking like you are hovering over it.</p><p><b>HELPFUL TIP:</b><i> You want to see just above table tops and couches. If you are seeing sink drains, you are too high.</i></p><h2>Straight verticals</h2><p>The #1 thing you can do to improve your photos. Straight verticals refers to when all the vertical lines in the shot are straight and not skewing towards the top or bottom. Straight verticals sometimes cannot be achieved at the time of shooting depending on the depth of the photo you are trying to take. </p><p>When framing the shot, you may find that the right depth happens at the same point where the photo also has straight verticals. This is great when this happens. Take the shot! But many times, you will have to skew the verticals, typically downward, to get the right depth. This is ok because you can fix the verticals in the Editing stage. But you cannot fix the depth once the photo has been taken.</p><h2>3 types of composition</h2><p>You have three compositions to choose between:</p><ul><li><b>Hard angle</b> - standing at a 45 angle of the closest piece of furniture. This kind of photo should be about 60% of your photos for any given listing.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Soft angle </b>- standing at a 20-30 degree angle to the closet piece of furniture should be 30% of your photos.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Straight on </b>- standing directly in front at a 90 degree angle to your subject, whether it be a fireplace, or bath tub, for example, should be 10% of your photos.</li></ul><p><b>HELPFUL TIP:</b> Hard angles are great for making unattractive rooms look better. For well-designed rooms, both the hard and the soft angles work well, but the soft angle doesn’t typically work well in poorly designed rooms.</p><h2>Kitchen</h2><p><b>1st photo:</b> countertop corner closest to you, put in lower third of the photo, put yourself in the position to see the countertop at a hard angle.</p><p><b>2nd photo: </b>countertop corner cropped off and then shoot tighter kitchen photo, at a soft angle</p><p><b>3rd photo: </b>Straight on and symmetrical low photo between island and sink in the kitchen by the fridge, OR if there is no island, or this photo doesn’t look good, another straight on photo anywhere in the kitchen.</p><p><b>4th, 5th, & 6th photos:</b> Shoot from every corner that makes sense<b></b></p><h2>Living room</h2><p>Do the same as the kitchen: shoot from every corner where it looks good. All four if possible. Not necessarily all the way into the corner though. Some photos should be wide open getting the whole room. The others should be closer photos. A straight on photo of the fireplace or over the coffee table with it centered, is sometimes nice.</p><h2>Bedroom</h2><p>Again, shoot from every corner where it looks good. You want to be just high enough to see some of the top of the bedspread.</p><h2>Small bathroom</h2><p>You typically only have one option, shoot from the doorway, from the side of the doorway furthest from the sink. Shoot in towards the sink. Sometimes when there is a mirror, you have to shoot really low in order to avoid being seen in the reflection. Laundry rooms, if they are very neatly organized, are typically going to be photo like a small bathroom.</p><h2>Master bathroom</h2><p>Master baths I like to try and get a straight on photo that has the sinks on one side and the bath/shower on the other, looking straight at the closet door or wall or toilet room or something. I always like to get some hard angle photos, or light angles if it’s a really nice design</p><h2>Exteriors</h2><p>Exteriors are a lot more subjective than the interiors. Sometimes homes look great straight on. Sometimes they look much better from an angle. Finding the right angle on an exterior is challenging even to the professional. Some rules to help:</p><p>Typically you want to see the front door in the photo. </p><p>Typically shooting at at least a small angle is preferred over a straight photo. Straight photos have a tendency to hide the depth of the house, making the house look smaller than it really is. </p><p><b></b></p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-global " data-reactid="20"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="21"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="22"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="23"><span data-reactid="24"><!-- react-empty: 25 --><h2 data-reactid="26"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="27">Composition</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="28"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="29"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="30"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
